## What are limits?

Two types of rules you can set per agent:

- **Notify** — Sends an email alert when a threshold is reached.
- **Block** — Returns HTTP 429 and stops requests when the threshold is reached.

## Creating a rule

    </Steps>

## How blocking works

When a "block" rule triggers, the next ingest request returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a message:

```
Limit exceeded: cost usage ($X) exceeds $Y per day
```

The block resets at the start of the next period.

## Email notifications

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloud">
    Emails are sent via the platform's mail provider. Make sure your account email is valid.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local">
    Configure an email provider in `~/.openclaw/manifest/config.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "email": {
        "provider": "mailgun",
        "apiKey": "key-...",
        "domain": "mg.example.com",
        "from": "alerts@example.com"
      }
    }
    ```

    Supported providers: Mailgun, Resend, SendGrid. If no provider is configured, email notifications are skipped (block rules still work).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Checking rules

- Rules are evaluated hourly (cron) for notifications, and on every ingest for blocks.
- A notification is sent once per rule per period to avoid spam.
