## What is routing?

Instead of sending every request to the same expensive model, Manifest scores each query and routes it to the cheapest model that can handle it.

- Four tiers: **simple**, **standard**, **complex**, **reasoning**.
- Scoring happens in under 2 ms with zero external calls.

## The four tiers

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Simple" icon="zap">
    Greetings, definitions, short factual questions. Routed to the cheapest model.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standard" icon="code">
    General coding help, moderate questions. Good quality at low cost.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complex" icon="layers">
    Multi-step tasks, large context, code generation. Best quality models.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reasoning" icon="brain">
    Formal logic, proofs, math, multi-constraint problems. Reasoning-capable models only.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How scoring works

23 dimensions grouped into two categories:

**Keyword-based (13)** — Scans the prompt for patterns like "prove", "write function", "what is", etc.

**Structural (10)** — Analyzes token count, nesting depth, code-to-prose ratio, tool count, conversation depth, etc.

Each dimension has a weight. The weighted sum maps to a tier via threshold boundaries. A confidence score (0–1) indicates how clearly the request fits its tier.

## Session momentum

Manifest remembers the last 5 tier assignments (30-minute TTL).

Short follow-up messages ("yes", "do it") inherit momentum from the conversation, preventing unnecessary tier drops.

## Tier overrides

Certain signals force a minimum tier:

| Signal | Minimum tier |
|--------|-------------|
| Tools detected | **standard** |
| Large context (>50k tokens) | **complex** |
| Formal logic keywords | **reasoning** |

## Response headers

Every routed response includes:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Manifest-Tier` | Assigned tier |
| `X-Manifest-Model` | Actual model used |
| `X-Manifest-Provider` | Provider (anthropic, openai, google, etc.) |
| `X-Manifest-Confidence` | Scoring confidence (0–1) |

## Cloud vs Local

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloud">
    Routing is performed server-side. Model mappings are managed by the Manifest team and updated regularly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local">
    Routing runs on your machine inside the embedded server. The model-to-tier mapping is seeded on first boot and can be customized in the dashboard.
