Manifest is an open-source OpenClaw plugin that routes queries to the most cost-effective model and gives you a real-time dashboard to track tokens, costs, and usage.

## Why Manifest

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Smart routing" icon="split">
    Scores each query across 23 dimensions and picks the cheapest model that can handle it. Saves up to 90%.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time dashboard" icon="chart-no-axes-combined">
    Track tokens, costs, messages, and model usage at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set limits" icon="shield-alert">
    Get notified or automatically block requests when spending exceeds a threshold.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it works

Manifest intercepts each OpenClaw request, runs a scoring algorithm in under 2 ms, assigns a tier (simple / standard / complex / reasoning), and forwards the query to the matching model. All telemetry is captured via OpenTelemetry and displayed in the dashboard.

## Manifest vs OpenRouter

| | Manifest | OpenRouter |
|---|---|---|
| **Open source** | Yes | No |
| **Self-hostable** | Yes | No |
| **Privacy** | Metadata only (or 100% local) | Full request proxied |
| **Routing logic** | Transparent, 23-dimension scoring | Black box |
| **Cost** | Free | Per-token markup |
| **Dashboard** | Built-in | Separate |
| **Works with OpenClaw** | Native plugin | Requires config |

## Privacy

- **Local mode:** All data stays on your machine. Nothing is sent anywhere.
- **Cloud mode:** Only OpenTelemetry metadata (model name, token counts, latency) is sent — never message content.
- **Opt-out of analytics:** Set `MANIFEST_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1` to disable anonymous usage analytics.
