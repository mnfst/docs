Manifest runs in two modes: **Cloud** (hosted at app.manifest.build) and **Local** (embedded on your machine). Both share the same features — the difference is where data lives and how auth works.

## Comparison

| | Cloud | Local |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Sign up + API key | Zero config |
| **Data storage** | PostgreSQL (hosted) | SQLite on your machine |
| **Dashboard** | app.manifest.build | http://127.0.0.1:2099 |
| **Auth** | Email/password or OAuth (Google, GitHub, Discord) | Auto-login (loopback trust) |
| **Multi-device** | Yes — access from any browser | No — localhost only |
| **API key** | Generated in dashboard (`mnfst_...`) | Auto-generated (`mnfst_local_...`) |
| **Email alerts** | Built-in (platform mail) | Requires provider config (Mailgun/Resend/SendGrid) |
| **Telemetry interval** | ~30 seconds | ~10 seconds |
| **Privacy** | Metadata only (no message content) | 100% on your machine |
| **Cost** | Free | Free |

## When to use Cloud

- You work across multiple machines.
- You want email alerts without configuring a mail provider.
- You want a managed experience with no local server.

## When to use Local

- Privacy is paramount — no data leaves your machine.
- You don't need multi-device access.
- You prefer zero-config, offline-capable tooling.

## Switching modes

```bash
# Switch to cloud
openclaw config set plugins.entries.manifest.config.mode cloud
openclaw config set plugins.entries.manifest.config.apiKey "mnfst_YOUR_KEY"
openclaw gateway restart

# Switch to local
openclaw config set plugins.entries.manifest.config.mode local
openclaw gateway restart
```

<Warning>Switching modes does not migrate data. Cloud and local have separate databases.</Warning>
