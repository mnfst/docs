# Webhooks

**Webhooks** are a way for an app to send automated real-time notifications to another app when a specific [event](./webhooks.md#hook-events) occurs. In Manifest, there are 8 predefined events where you can hook HTTP requests.

Webhooks are useful to connect other applications or to trigger a micro-service like notifying someone or update a file.

## Syntax

```yaml title="manifest/backend.yml"
entities:
  # You can attach one or several webhooks to each entity event.
  Cat üò∫:
    properties:
      - name
    hooks:
      beforeCreate:
        - { url: 'https://my-webhook.com' }

  Dog üê∂:
    properties:
      - name
    hooks:
      afterDelete:
        # Pass .env variables with ${} interpolation.
        - {
            url: 'https://another-webhook.com',
            headers: { authorization: 'Bearer ${API_KEY}' },
          }
        # Specific HTTP method.
        - { url: 'https://another-one.com', method: 'PATCH' }
```

## Webhook params

You can pass arguments using the long syntax:

| Option      | Default | Type          | Description                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **url\***   | -       | string        | The URL of your webhook                                                                |
| **method**  | `POST`  | _HTTP Method_ | The HTTP method of the request                                                         |
| **headers** | `{}`    | object        | Optional headers of the request. Use `${MY_DOTENV_VAR}` syntax to use dotenv variables |

Available HTTP Methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

:::note

Manifest does not enforce HTTP request success or failure; the lifecycle process continues regardless.

:::

## Webhook body

Manifest attaches a **JSON body** with key information about the record concerned to the webhook HTTP request.

Each event is different, so is the body of the webhook HTTP Request. Nevertheless the main structure of the body will remain the same and only the `record` value will change.

This is the structure of the body:

```json title="HTTP request body (content-type is application/json)"
{
  "event": "beforeUpdate",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-22T13:38:48.399Z",
  "entity": "posts",
  "record": {
    "title": "my title",
    "content": "my content"
  }
}
```

## Hook events

| Name             | "record" content       | Description              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **beforeCreate** | Item DTO               | Before creating a record |
| **afterCreate**  | Created item (with id) | After creating a record  |
| **beforeUpdate** | Item DTO               | Before updating a record |
| **afterUpdate**  | Updated item (with id) | After updating a record  |
| **beforeDelete** | id only                | Before deleting a record |
| **afterDelete**  | Deleted item (with id) | After deleting a record  |
