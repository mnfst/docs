# S3 Storage

Manifest supports **S3 storage** to manage assets.

## Configuration

### 1. Prepare Your Storage Service

To use Manifest with an external storage service, ensure you have:

- A **storage bucket** (or equivalent).
- Access credentials with read and write permissions.

:::note  
S3 storage in Manifest has been **validated** with **AWS S3** and **DigitalOcean Spaces**. Other S3-compatible providers may work, but they have not been officially tested.  
:::

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Define these variables in your environment:

```sh
S3_BUCKET=my-bucket-name
S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-s3-provider.com
S3_REGION=XXX
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
```
